# Mercury Volatility Regime & Auction Structure

Vol regime tells you *how* the market is moving. AMT structure tells you *where* it is. Together they give context for any directional or positioning view.

> **Vol regimes can shift fast — especially around data. Always fetch fresh data before drawing conclusions.**

---

## Step 1 — Market Texture Overview

```
get_market_texture()
```

One-liner per complex: what regime is each in?

Common regimes:
- **Compressed / Quiet** — low vol, expect expansion eventually
- **Normal-Rising** — orderly trending move
- **Spike-Rising** — sharp vol expansion, potentially news-driven
- **Choppy/Balance** — two-sided, mean-reverting

Flag anything that looks like a regime inflection (e.g. compressed → spiking).

---

## Step 2 — Ask: Which Instrument?

> "Which instrument do you want to dig into — or would you like a broad vol scan across all complexes?"

**If broad scan:** proceed to Step 3
**If specific instrument:** jump to Step 4

---

## Step 3 — Broad Vol Scan

```
get_market_overview(fields=["symbol", "vol_regime", "pos_5d", "pos_20d", "ret_1d_pct"])
```

Rank instruments by vol regime severity (Spike-Rising > Normal-Rising > Compressed). Flag:
- Anything in Spike-Rising not explained by an obvious catalyst
- Large mismatches between 5d range position and 1d move (vol whipsaw)

---

## Step 4 — Single Instrument Vol Detail

```
get_volatility_metrics(symbol="<symbol>")
```

Report:
- **Realised Vol (RV):** current vs historical norm — elevated or suppressed?
- **HMM Regime:** what state is the vol model in?
- **ADR (Average Daily Range):** how much has it moved today vs its typical daily range? How much room is left?
- **Implied vs Realised gap** (if available): options pricing more/less vol than realised?

Translate into plain language: *"ES has used 60% of its ADR already — limited room for extension if vol stays in current regime."*

---

## Step 5 — Auction Structure (AMT)

```
get_amt_snapshot(symbol="<symbol>")
```

The vol context should be read with AMT:

- **High vol + above value area** → breakout attempt, aggressive buyers
- **High vol + below value area** → breakdown, sellers in control
- **Low vol inside value area** → balance/consolidation, awaiting catalyst
- **Single prints above/below** → market has not returned to test these levels yet — potential magnet

Present: where is price vs POC, VAH, VAL? Are there unfilled single prints nearby?

---

## Step 6 — VIX Context

```
get_symbol_detail(symbol="^VIX")
```

VIX level:
- Below 15 → complacency / low-vol regime
- 15–20 → normal
- 20–30 → elevated concern
- Above 30 → fear / crisis mode

Note: VIX above 25 while equities are holding up can signal vol sellers stepping in. VIX compressing while equities fall = unusual, worth flagging.

---

## Step 7 — News Driver Check (if vol spike)

```
get_squawk_context(topic="volatility market risk")
```

Is there a headline explaining the spike? Or is it a technical/positioning move?

Ask: *"The vol spike in [instrument] [is/isn't] explained by headlines. Want me to look for a specific catalyst in the news flow?"*
